\section{Bio}

I am a fourth year PhD student in the Computer Science department.
I originally started under the supervision of Professor Paul Hudak, working on developing programming languages for computer music.
Specifically, we studied a model of computation called Functional Reactive Programming (FRP).
Since his passing, I have been working with Professor Ruzica Piskac on program synthesis.
Recently, our work has focused on synthesis of FRP programs from logical specifications.

I plan to use the synthesis framework we are currently developing to continue to advance my work in the digital arts.
I previously presented installation art at various shows~\cite{gls,isosteeple}, have published in the digital arts research community~\cite{ICMC2015, FARM2015}, and recently served as the publicity chair for the FARM (Functional Art and Music) workshop.
My goal is to continue working in this direction, and this installation would provide an interesting application of my current work.

I will outline here my initial proposal, and also how it connects to my current research project.
However, I am a strong believer that good art is a dialogue and would be interested in any feedback on this project.
I look forward to starting a conversation with the quantum physics department.
