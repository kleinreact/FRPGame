\section{Bio}

I am a fourth year PhD student in the Computer Science department.
I originally started under the supervision on Paul Hudak, working on computer music in functional languages.
Since his passing, I have been working with Ruzica Piskac on verification.
Although my current work is focused on formal methods, I am still active in the digital art community.

I recently served as the publicity chair for the FARM (Functional Art and Music) workshop.
